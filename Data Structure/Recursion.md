Recursive approach is not necessarily any more beautiful or efficient than using a classic for loop.
**One type of problem in which recursion is a natural fit is when we need to delve into multiple layers of a problem without knowing how many layers there are.**

**Base Case**
==In recursion terminology, the case in which our function will not recurse is known as the base case.==

The computer uses a stack to keep track of which functions itâ€™s in the middle of calling.

**Recursion is often a great choice for an algorithm in which the algorithm needs to dig into an arbitrary number of levels deep into something.**
