###  Java Map
Outline: Print the phone number of certain person from a Map.

You are given a phone book that consists of people's names and their phone number. After that you will be given some person's name as query. For each query, print the phone number of that person.

**Input Format**

The first line will have an integer  denoting the number of entries in the phone book. Each entry consists of two lines: a name and the corresponding phone number.  

After these, there will be some queries. Each query will contain a person's name. Read the queries until end-of-file.

_Constraints:_  
A person's name consists of only lower-case English letters and it may be in the format 'first-name last-name' or in the format 'first-name'. Each phone number has exactly 8 digits without any leading zeros.

**Output Format**

For each case, print "Not found" if the person has no entry in the phone book. Otherwise, print the person's name and phone number. See sample output for the exact format.

To make the problem easier, we provided a portion of the code in the editor. You can either complete that code or write completely on your own.

**Sample Input**

```
3
uncle sam
99912222
tom
11122222
harry
12299933
uncle sam
uncle tom
harry
```

**Sample Output**

```
uncle sam=99912222
Not found
harry=12299933
```



## Java 2D Array
Outline: Print the largest sum among all the hourglasses in the array.

You are given a  2D array. An hourglass in an array is a portion shaped like this:
```
a b c
  d
e f g
```

For example, if we create an hourglass using the number 1 within an array full of zeros, it may look like this:
```
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```
Actually, there are many hourglasses in the array above. The three leftmost hourglasses are the following:

```
1 1 1     1 1 0     1 0 0
  1         0         0
1 1 1     1 1 0     1 0 0
```

The sum of an hourglass is the sum of all the numbers within it. The sum for the hourglasses above are 7, 4, and 2, respectively.

In this problem you have to _print the largest sum among all the hourglasses_ in the array.

**Input Format**

There will be exactly  lines, each containing  integers seperated by spaces. Each integer will be between  and  inclusive.

**Output Format**

Print the answer to this problem on a single line.

**Sample Input**

```
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 2 4 4 0
0 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 1 2 4 0
```

**Sample Output**

```
19
```

**Explanation**

The hourglass which has the largest sum is:

```
2 4 4
  2
1 2 4
```


## Check if a String Is a Palindrome

A phrase is a **palindrome** if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` _if it is a **palindrome**, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "race a car"
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** "raceacar" is not a palindrome.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = " "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
