## 1. Bringing Solutions, Not Just Problems

**Junior behavior:** "The client is unhappy with our proposal. What should I do?"

**Senior behavior:** "The client expressed concerns about our timeline and budget. I've prepared three alternatives that address their concerns while protecting our other projects in-flight. Here's a quick analysis of each option, and my recommendation. I'd like your input before I respond to them."

Juniors identify problems and escalate them upward. They see their job as finding issues and reporting them to someone with more authority.

Senior professionals take ownership. They investigate, analyze options, and come with solutions. They're not looking for someone to solve problems for them – they're looking for buy-in.

I'll never forget when a junior team member came to me about a major client issue. Instead of just reporting that the client was dissatisfied, he arrived with a detailed rundown of what went wrong, three potential ways to address it, and a clear recommendation based on his analysis. He had thought through the customer impact, the business implications, and even the potential ripple effects on other projects. In that moment, I knew he was ready for more responsibility.

“Look at you,” I thought with a smile.

He was promoted the next quarter.

## 2. Status Broadcasting vs. Status Reporting

**Junior behavior:** "Yes, I'm still working on the checkout feature. It should be done by next week."

**Senior behavior:** "I've completed the first three milestones on the checkout feature. We're on track for Friday's deadline, but I've identified a potential integration issue with the payment gateway that might cause a delay. I've already reached out to the payments team, and we've scheduled time tomorrow to resolve it."

Junior developers answer questions about status because they have to be asked. Senior developers proactively communicate progress, obstacles, and timelines before anyone has to ask.

This proactive communication isn't just about looking good–it's about reducing management overhead. Every time a manager has to ask for a status update, it's another thing on their already full plate. When team members push important updates without prompting, they're demonstrating leadership and lightening their manager's load.

During a particularly challenging project at Amazon, I noticed one developer was consistently sending thoughtful end-of-week updates that highlighted progress, blockers, and next steps. These updates were concise but valuable, giving everyone the important information they needed . This seemingly small habit made her stand out as someone ready for more responsibility.

## 3. Upleveling Others vs. Self-Focus

**Junior behavior:** "I figured out how to navigate our complex data architecture to get the insights I needed."

**Senior behavior:** "I created a guide to our data architecture with examples of common queries and pitfalls to avoid. I'm hosting a working session to walk through it and have already helped three team members implement it for their projects."

Junior developers focus on their own growth, which is natural and necessary early in a career. Senior developers recognize that their impact multiplies when they help others improve.

One of the most telling signs of seniority is the shift from "How can I become better?" to "How can I make my team better?" This doesn't mean neglecting your own growth–it means recognizing that elevating those around you creates compound returns.

This happened naturally for me when I realized I could only scale myself so much. A senior developer on my team once told me, "The best code I'll ever write is the code I help others write."

## 4. Zooming Out to Business Context

**Junior behavior:** "This project will take about two weeks to complete."

**Senior behavior:** "I understand this project could increase customer satisfaction by 15%, which our data shows would lead to a 5% boost in retention. Given that potential impact, I recommend we prioritize it over the other items on our roadmap, which would have less direct impact on our key metrics."

Juniors think in terms of tasks and timelines. Senior professionals connect their work to business outcomes.

Understanding the "why" behind decisions allows seniors to make better trade-offs, prioritize effectively, and advocate for resources. It also positions them as strategic partners rather than just task rabbits.

I remember a meeting where our team was debating which items to include in the sprint. It was a long meeting because there were too many things to do but only so much capacity. Most team members were advocating for items based on personal interest, what seemed most straightforward to implement, or what things would take the most time. One colleague, however, reframed the entire discussion by tying each item to our team goals. That perspective instantly elevated her influence in the room because it drove clarity in how we shoud prioritize.

## 5. Embracing Ambiguity

**Junior behavior:** "The requirements aren't clear. I won't start until they're finalized."

**Senior behavior:** "The requirements have some ambiguity. I've identified the areas we can move forward on immediately, and I've scheduled time with stakeholders to clarify the uncertain aspects while development begins."

Junior developers are often paralyzed by unclear requirements. Senior developers recognize that perfect clarity is rare and know how to make effective progress despite ambiguity.

I've seen junior developers spend days, weeks, or even months waiting for "final" requirements that never come, while their senior counterparts were already building, testing assumptions, and iterating based on feedback.

During my time at Amazon, we often had to make decisions with incomplete information. My go-to approach was to break things down into "known" and "unknown" components, then start work on the known aspects while actively investigating the unknowns. If the unknown bucket was too big, sure, we needed to block waiting until there was more information, but most of the time there was a healthy set of things we knew needed to do.

## 6. Taking Ownership of Career Growth

**Junior behavior:** "When will my manager give me bigger scoped work?"

**Senior behavior:** "I've identified an area on my own where I can add significant value beyond my current responsibilities. Here's my plan for taking this on while ensuring my primary work doesn't suffer."

Juniors wait for growth opportunities to be handed to them. Seniors create their own opportunities by identifying gaps and stepping into them.

I've mentored many engineers who felt stuck in their roles, waiting for someone to notice their potential and offer them more responsibility, but the most successful ones were those who proactively identified important work.

The reality is that every workplace has way more problems than anybody could ever solve. Juniors only do the work that is assigned to them. Seniors search for and solve next-level problems that already exist.

## 7. Trading Perfectionism for Pragmatism

**Junior behavior:** "We need to completely refactor our codebase before adding any new features. It's a total mess, and I want to make everything clean and elegant first."

**Senior behavior:** "I've identified the critical areas of technical debt in our codebase that are actively slowing us down. I've created a roadmap that lets us address these issues incrementally while continuing to deliver business value. We'll improve the most problematic components first and gradually enhance the architecture over time."

Juniors often pursue the ideal at the expense of delivering value. They see perfection as a prerequisite to progress. Seniors understand that perfect code is impossible in evolving systems and have evolved a sense of “good enough,” which is still high-quality, but avoids expending effort on diminishing returns.

At Amazon, I once worked with a team maintaining a legacy system with significant architectural challenges, technical debt, and spaghetti code. A junior engineer insisted we needed to a rewrite before implementing new features. Our senior engineer took a different approach: he mapped the codebase's problem areas against upcoming business needs, created a prioritized improvement plan that aligned with feature development, and established clear guidelines for when to refactor and when to work within existing constraints. This way we weren’t adding to the mess while we made progress.

## Start Acting Senior Today

Here's the secret that took me years to learn: **You don't need permission to start adopting these behaviors.**

Your behavior determines your actual level of seniority, not your title. Start acting like a senior developer today, and your title will eventually catch up to your behavior.
