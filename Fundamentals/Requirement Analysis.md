#### What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement analysis is the process of understanding, documenting, validating, and managing the needs and constraints of stakeholders for a software system. It bridges the gap between business objectives and technical implementation by clearly defining what the system should do.

#### Fundamentals of Requirement Analysis

1. **Stakeholder Identification**: Recognize all parties affected by the system
2. **Requirement Elicitation**: Gather requirements through various techniques
3. **Requirement Classification**: Categorize requirements (functional, non-functional, etc.)
4. **Requirement Documentation**: Create clear, unambiguous specifications    
5. **Requirement Validation**: Ensure requirements are complete and correct
6. **Requirement Management**: Handle changes and maintain traceability

#### End-to-End Requirement Analysis Flow for the Lab Test Booking System

#### 1. Stakeholder Analysis

**Identified Stakeholders**:
- Primary: Patients/Users (booking tests)
- Secondary: Lab/Facility Admins (mentioned but currently out of scope)
- Tertiary: Developers/Admins (technical management)
#### 2. Requirement Elicitation

**Techniques Used**:
- Document analysis (reviewing the provided assignment doc)
- Interface analysis (examining the Figma design)
- Assumption analysis (for unspecified details)

### 3. Requirement Classification

#### Functional Requirements:

**User Management**:
- FR1: System shall allow user registration with required fields (name, mobile, password)
- FR2: System shall provide login functionality with email/mobile and password
- FR3: System shall allow users to manage their profiles

**Test Booking**:

- FR4: System shall allow users to search and view available tests
- FR5: System shall allow users to select preferred lab facility
- FR6: System shall allow users to choose appointment date
- FR7: System shall enable appointment submission
- FR8: System shall allow users to track appointment status
- FR9: System shall provide appointment history

**System Operations**:

- FR10: System shall securely store all booking records

#### Non-Functional Requirements:

- NFR1: Web-based system using Spring Boot (Java)
- NFR2: RESTful API with token-based authentication
- NFR3: Secure data storage with encrypted PHI
- NFR4: Scalable database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- NFR5: Responsive user interface (implied by web/mobile access)

#### Business Rules:

- BR1: Mobile number is mandatory for registration
- BR2: Email is optional for registration
- BR3: Password must be confirmed during registration
- BR4: Test name and lab facility are mandatory for booking
- BR5: Appointment date is mandatory for booking

### 4. Requirement Documentation

**Structured Requirements Specification**:

1. **User Registration Module**:
    
    - Fields: Name (text, required), Mobile (numeric, required), Gender (dropdown, optional), Email (email, optional), Password (text, required), Confirm Password (text, required), DOB (date, optional)
        
    - Validation: Password confirmation must match, mobile format validation, email format validation if provided
        
2. **Test Booking Module**:
    
    - Fields: Test Name (dropdown, required), Preferred Lab (dropdown, required), Appointment Date (date, required), Notes (text, optional)
        
    - Workflow: User selects test → selects lab → chooses date → adds optional notes → submits
        
3. **Appointment Management**:
    
    - Status tracking with notifications
        
    - Historical record of all appointments
        

### 5. Requirement Validation

**Validation Techniques**:

- Cross-checking with Figma design for UI consistency
    
- Verifying all user flows are covered (registration → booking → tracking)
    
- Ensuring all field requirements and validations are specified
    
- Checking for completeness (no missing screens or functions in workflow)
    

### 6. Gap Analysis

**Identified Gaps/Ambiguities**:

1. Password complexity requirements not specified
    
2. Mobile number format validation not defined (country code, length)
    
3. Date format for DOB and appointment not specified
    
4. Notification delivery method not specified (in-app, SMS, email)
    
5. Test/lab dropdown population logic not described
    
6. Error handling scenarios not covered
    

**Assumptions Made**:

1. Password requires minimum 8 characters with at least one letter and one number
    
2. Mobile numbers follow national format (10 digits for example)
    
3. Dates use ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
    
4. Notifications are in-app with optional email if provided
    
5. Tests and labs come from a predefined database
    
6. Basic error handling with user-friendly messages
    

### 7. Requirement Prioritization

**MoSCoW Prioritization**:

- MUST HAVE: User registration, test booking, appointment tracking
    
- SHOULD HAVE: Profile management, appointment history
    
- COULD HAVE: Notes field in booking
    
- WON'T HAVE: Lab admin features (explicitly out of scope)
    

### 8. Use Case Modeling

**Primary Use Cases**:

1. Register New Account
    
2. Login to System
    
3. Search for Available Tests
    
4. Book Lab Test Appointment
    
5. View Appointment Status
    
6. View Appointment History
    

### 9. User Stories

1. "As a patient, I want to register with my basic details so I can book tests"
    
2. "As a registered user, I want to search for available tests so I can choose what I need"
    
3. "As a user, I want to select a lab and date for my test so I can complete my booking"
    
4. "As a user, I want to see my upcoming appointments so I can plan my visit"
    

### 10. Technical Considerations

**Architecture**:

- Frontend: Web application (implied by Figma)
    
- Backend: Spring Boot (Java)
    
- API: RESTful with JWT authentication
    
- Database: Relational (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
    
- Security: PHI encryption, password hashing
    

### 11. Future Enhancement Planning

**Documented for Roadmap**:

1. Payment gateway integration
    
2. Test report management
    
3. Email notification system
    
4. Lab admin dashboard
    
5. Time slot booking precision
