In Spring Security, filters are components that intercept HTTP requests and responses. They form a chain, known as the filter chain, and each filter performs a specific task, such as authentication, authorization, or request modification. "Before" and "after" filters refer to the placement of a custom filter within this chain, relative to existing Spring Security filters.

- **Before Filters:**
    
    These filters are executed before a specified Spring Security filter. They are useful for tasks that need to occur early in the request processing, such as:
    
    - **Custom authentication mechanisms:** If the application uses a non-standard authentication method, a before filter can extract authentication information from the request and set it in the security context before the standard authentication filters are invoked.
    - **Request preprocessing:** Tasks like logging, input validation, or modifying request headers can be performed in a before filter.
    - **CSRF protection:** A filter can be placed before the `CsrfFilter` to handle custom CSRF token handling.
    
- **After Filters:**
    
    These filters are executed after a specified Spring Security filter. They are suitable for tasks that depend on the outcome of previous filters, such as:
    
    - **Response modification:** After the request has been processed, an after filter can modify the response, for example, by adding custom headers or formatting the response body.
    - **Auditing:** Logging the outcome of security decisions or other relevant information can be done in an after filter.
    - **Error handling:** A filter can be placed after the exception handling filters to perform custom error processing or logging.
