Static members are associated with the class itself, not with any specific instance (object) of the class. This means that ==there's only one copy of the static member, shared by all instances of the class==.

- **Shared vs. Unique:**
    Static members are shared by all instances of the class, so any changes made to a static member will be reflected across all instances. Non-static members are unique to each instance, and changes to one instance won't affect others.
