In the context of GC
"throughput" refers to the percentage of time your application spends actively executing code rather than performing garbage collection, essentially indicating how much work can be done in a given time period, while "latency" represents the time taken for a single garbage collection event to occur, meaning the pause time your application experiences during garbage collection
