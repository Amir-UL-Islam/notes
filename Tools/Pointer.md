```
int x = 5;
int * pointer_to_x = &x;

```
When a ```asterisk(*)``` is next to a Type, Say ```int * pointer_to_x```  Here ```pointer_to_x ``` is now a pointer to a integer.
And the ```ampersand(&) ``` says the address of some variable.

### And Finally
```
int y = * pointer_to_x;
```
Here ```asterisk(*)``` is actually dereferencing the Value of the pointer.
