### Learnings
No response is the most powerful response
Science speaks louder than words. When you stay quiet you maintain control of yourself and the situation.

Always remain calm. Never let stress on your face. Calmness is strength. The moment you lose your composure you lose your power. When you appear calm even under pressure, people will respect you.

Stop overthinking if you cannot control it do not react to it.
Overthinking is like sitting on a rocking chair. It gives you something to do but it gets you nowhere
